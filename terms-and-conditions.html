          <p>
            To help protect your personal information from unauthorized access
            and use, we endeavor to use reasonable security measures. These
            measures can include physical, electronic and procedural safeguards
            such as computer safeguards and secured files and buildings. We also
            endeavor to limit access to personal information to only employees,
            agents and representatives that need to know. Despite our efforts,
            third parties may unlawfully intercept or access your personal
            information, transmissions to us, or may wrongly instruct you to
            disclose information to them by posing as Nairagram or by
            misinforming you about our services. Always use caution and good
            judgment when sending money and when using internet and mobile
            technologies.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.1 Subject to these Terms and Conditions, we agree to provide the
            Service to you using reasonable care. The Service may not be
            available in whole or in part in certain regions, countries, or
            jurisdictions.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.2 We are not obliged to process any particular Transaction. When
            you submit a Transaction, you are requesting that we process the
            Transaction on your behalf. We may, in our sole discretion, choose
            whether or not to accept the offer to process that Transaction.
            However, if we decide not to process the Transaction, we will notify
            you promptly of that decision and repay the money paid to us if we
            are not prohibited by law from doing so.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.3 Nairagram reserves the right to modify or discontinue the
            service or any part of the Service without notice, at any time and
            from time to time. We may, in our absolute discretion, refuse any
            Transaction or limit the amount to be transferred, either on a per
            transaction basis or on an aggregate basis, and either on individual
            accounts or on related accounts.
          </p>

          <p>
            3.4 We may, in our sole discretion, refuse Transactions from certain

            from time to time by the US Government. In addition, not all Payment
            Instruments are available to all customers at all times and we may,
            in our sole discretion, refuse Transactions funded from certain

          </p>

          <p>
            3.5 We will attempt to process Transactions promptly, but any
            Transaction may be delayed or cancelled for a number of reasons
            including but not limited to: our efforts to verify your identity;
            to validate your Transaction instructions; to contact you; or
            otherwise to comply with applicable law; or due to variations in
            business hours and currency availability.

        <div>
          <p class="lato16px green" id="t-use">4. TERMS OF USE</p>

          <p>
            You agree that: <br />
            4.1 you will not access, use or attempt to use the Service as a
            Sender unless you are at least 18 years old, and that you have the
            legal capacity to form a binding legal contract in the relevant
            jurisdiction;
          </p>

          <p>
            4.2 for each Transaction that you submit, you will pay us a
            Processing Fee in addition to the Transaction Amount. Payment
            becomes due at the time that you submit your Transaction. If you
            submit a Transaction that results in Nairagram becoming liable for
            charges including but not limited to chargeback or other fees, you
            agree to reimburse us for all such fees;
          </p>

          <p>
            4.3 in connection with your registration and use of the Service, you
            will:
          </p>

          <p>
            4.3.1 provide us with true, accurate, current and complete evidence
            of your identity, and promptly update your personal information if
            and when it changes;
          </p>

          <p>
            4.3.2 provide us and/or our merchant with details of one or more
            Payment Instruments; and
          </p>

          <p>
            4.3.3 provide us with true, accurate, current and complete
            information for all Transactions. We do not accept any liability for
            damages resulting from non-payment or delay in payment of a money
            transfer to a Recipient or failure to perform a transaction under
            the Service by reason of any of these matters.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.4 when you pay for a Transaction in one currency and the Recipient
            is paid in another currency, there will be a difference between the
            exchange rate at which we buy foreign currency and the exchange rate
            provided to you. Nairagram and its Service Providers usually make a
            small profit in these circumstances. If a Recipient’s account is
            denominated in another currency there may be delays, additional
            charges or different exchange rates.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.5 when you are sending money under these Terms and Conditions, it
            is your responsibility to make sure all the Transaction details are
            accurate before submission. Once a Transaction has been submitted
            for processing it is not normally possible to change any of its
            details. You will be given the opportunity to confirm transaction
            details before submission and you must check the details carefully.
          </p>

          <p>
            4.6 Nairagram will have no responsibility for any fees or charges
            you may incur by the use of a particular Payment Instrument to fund
            a Transaction. These may include but are not limited to unauthorized
            overdraft fees imposed by banks if there are insufficient funds in
            your bank account or "cash advance" fees and additional interest
            which may be imposed by credit card providers if they treat use of
            the Service as a cash transaction rather than a purchase
            transaction;
          </p>

          <p>
            4.7 you will only use the Service to send money to people that you
            know personally and not to pay for goods or services. If, in breach
            of this clause, you choose to pay third parties for goods and
            services using the Service, you acknowledge that Nairagram has no
            control over, and is not responsible for, the quality, safety,
            legality, or delivery of such goods or services and that any such
            use of the Service is entirely at your own risk. If Nairagram
            reasonably believes you are using the Service to purchase goods or
            services, we reserve the right to cancel your Transaction(s);
          </p>

          <p>
            4.8 in using the Service you will comply with these Terms and
            Conditions as well as any applicable laws, rules or regulations. It
            is a breach of these Terms and Conditions to use the Service to send
            money (i) to a Recipient who has violated the Terms and Conditions,
            or (ii) in connection with illegal activity including without
            limitation money-laundering, fraud and the funding of terrorist
            organizations. If you use the Service in connection with illegal
            activity, Nairagram may report you to the appropriate legal
            authorities;
          </p>

          <p>
            4.9 when using our website or the Service or when interacting with
            Nairagram, with another user or with a third party, you will not:
          </p>

          <p>
            4.10 breach these Terms and Conditions, or any other agreement
            between you and Nairagram;
          </p>

          <p>
            4.10.1 open more than one account, without our prior written
            permission;
          </p>

          <p>4.10.2 provide false, inaccurate, or misleading information;</p>

          <p>
            4.10.3 allow anyone else access to your registration details, and
            will keep those details secure;

            <p>
              5.1 You have a right to cancel a Transaction before payment has

              web and software applications, you may exercise this right by:

          <p>
            5.2 If you exercise your right to cancel a Transaction or if we
            cancel the Transaction, after you have already paid us for the
            service to be rendered:
          </p>

          <p>
            5.2.1 we will refund money paid by you and intended for a Recipient
            only under the condition that it has not already been paid out to
            the Recipient in accordance with your original instructions prior to
            the cancellation request; and
          </p>

          <p>
            5.2.2 we reserve the right to retain the Fees charged for the
            Service (and we may charge you for those Fees if they have not yet
            been paid) unless the Transaction is cancelled because it was
            erroneously processed, not processed or delayed for which we are
            liable under the relevant Money Transfer Regulations
          </p>

          <p>
            5.2.3 if by the time you notify us of the cancellation of the
            transfer we have already sent the money to one of our partners in
            the country of destination, we may not be able to successfully
            cancel the order, given that the cancellation procedures with our
            partners differ in length and complexity, as well as often require
            communication across time zones.

            The US law requires all financial institutions to assist in the
            fight against money laundering activities and the funding of
            terrorism by obtaining, verifying, and recording identifying
            information about all customers. Like most companies, we collect
            various types of data about our customers. Some of it may be
            considered personal data, which means data that make you
            identifiable as an individual. We may collect and use the following
            data:
          </p>

          <section>

            requirement to collect, verify and record certain data about you or
            recipients of your transactions. Any personal data received from the
            customer for the purpose of preventing money laundering or terrorist
            financing will be used only for that purpose and nothing more. This
            data will be needed to conduct Know Your Customer (KYC), Customer
            Due Diligence (CDD) and security checks, as required by local and
            international regulations. This helps us keep your money safe, and

          <p>
            We take security very seriously at Nairagram, and we work hard,
            using state-of-the-art security measures, to make sure that your
            information remains secure. The Nairagram Service is a safe and
            convenient way to send money to friends and family and to other
            people that you trust. However, we do advise you to consider very
            carefully before sending money to anyone that you do not know well.
            In particular, you should be very cautious of deals or offers that
            seem too good to be true - they may be scams. If you are aware of
            anyone or any entity that is using the Service inappropriately,
            please email us using our contact form. Similarly, if you receive
            any emails, purporting to be from Nairagram, which you suspect may
            be "phishing" (fake) emails, please forward them to us using our
            contact form.
